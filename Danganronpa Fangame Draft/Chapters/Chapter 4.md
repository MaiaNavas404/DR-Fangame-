LEFT: 9

In the aftermath of [[Chapter 3]], there's a lot of tension in the group. [[Monocam]] makes everyone form a duo, and they have to do bonding exercises together. 

[[Chef]] and [[Cult Leader]] had been planning murder for a while. They serve their victim for lunch. Before the motive can even be announced (It was going to be at dinner). 

The food is meat, served with vegetables and rich seasoning. With every meal [[Chef]] serves, he credits [[Cult Leader]] for the inspiration and reminisces about putting aside their differences. 

The other characters don't know until for dessert they serve the head on a silver platter. As everyone is shocked and horrified by the death of the [[Gardener]], [[Chef]] thanks him for offering his flesh and produce for their food. 

The [[Cult Leader]] is the one who committed murder, but the [[Chef]] is adamant it was him or [[Acrobat]], making solving the murder difficult despite the seemingly obvious culprit.
